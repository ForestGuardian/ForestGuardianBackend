# Forest Guardian Project

Forest Guardian is a mobile application (iOS and Android platforms), intended to aid in the prediction and control of forest fires. With the acquisition of data from sources such as MODIS based on NASA data, an analysis of factors such as active fire locations, wind, weather, access points, the population, among others, helps determine the degree of risk that is in an area with a forest fire and mapping it through a region. The conclusions of this analysis will give information as routes and closes aid to stop the fire. This project was presented as part of the final international round in The NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2015, category Galactic Impact.
